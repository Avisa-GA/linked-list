## Linked Lists
> Linked lists are a foundational data structure used by many complex data structures.
> > <p>The key component of a linked list is a <strong>node</strong>. Other advanced data structures use nodes, too, but in a linked list specifically, a node is a unit containing two things at the same time:</p>
> > <ul>
> > <li>A <span style="color:red">data</span> property that stores a value.</li>
> > <li>A next property, sometimes called a “pointer,” that points to the next item in the list.</li>
> > </ul>
